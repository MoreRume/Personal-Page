<h2>About Rume</h2>
<div class="centered"><!--this makes it so I can give padding to this section-->
<p>I've always had a love of adventure. Using just basic construction and food industry skiils,
    I found ways to live in the places rich people vacation. I found ways to learn new skills and 
    was honing them anytime I wasn't exploring, wether from other adventures or the clients.
</p>
<p>Now I have found myself on a new adventure, parenthood. Balancing learning new things with passing
    on what I have learned is a rewarding challange all on its own. As my life and the world kept changing,
    I decided to take on something I have always wanted to do, become a software engineer.
</p>
<p>I would have never thought I would be so fufilled solving technical problems and teaching reading.
    But now I feel I have found my callings in life. Hopefully I can use what I know to solve some of your problems.
